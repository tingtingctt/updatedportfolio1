# GitHomework-02-Portfolio

## Deployed Website

https://tingtingctt.github.io/updatedportfolio1/

## Content Updated

* Updated portfolio page with screenshot images, featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments. 

* Added deployed links to featured projects (by clicking on each portfolio image)

* Added links to portfolio github repositories (by clicking on the github icons in the caption's line)

* Attached a link to resume.pdf in the NavBar

* Added github link to the About Page

* Added email and phone number to the foot of About Page

## Design Updated

* Made mobile-first design using media query

* Using media query, the nav bar is responsive to smaller screens, where the expanded narbar menu will switch to a simpler dropdown menu.

* When a portfolio image or its github icon is clicked, a new window will be opened to be redirected - so that the audience won't have to leave the page.


## Background Images:

* The background images right now are still quite experimentary (just for fun), but I will change them to something more palatable and compatible with my future portfolio as more projects are added...
