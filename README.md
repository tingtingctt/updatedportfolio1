The website is created as desktop-first, and then made to be responsive to smaller screens.

Header:
--The three pages (index, portfolio and contact) are linked through the nav bar.
--Using media query, the nav bar is responsive to smaller screens, where the expanded narbar menu will switch to a simpler dropdown menu.
--The title font "Tingting Chen" is linked to Google Fonts, whose font-size is responsive to smaller screens.

Body:
--In index.html, the bio image is created using Bootstrap carousel function.
--In index.html, the links to social media are made with Font Awesome, and will be prompted to open a new tab using "target="_blank".
--In portfolio.html, the layout is made to be resposive to sm and sx screens, where the default three-column design will shrink to two-column and one-column respectively, as the user shrinks the window size.
--In portfolio.html, the caption of each portfolio image is made with "position:absolute" and "z-index" of 1.

Footer:
--The footer is made with "fixed-bottom", so that the copyright sign will always show at the bottom of the screen.

Background Images:
--The background images right now are quite ostentatious (just for fun), but I will change them to something more palatable and compatible with my real portfolio as it begins to shape...
